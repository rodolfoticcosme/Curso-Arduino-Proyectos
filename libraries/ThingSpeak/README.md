# ThingSpeak Communication Library for Arduino, ESP8266 and ESP32

This library enables an Arduino or other compatible hardware to write or read data to or from ThingSpeak, an open data platform for the Internet of Things with MATLAB analytics and visualization.

Hardware specific <a href="http://github.com/mathworks/thingspeak-arduino/tree/master/examples">examples</a> are found here. But to give you an idea of usage examples for <a href="#typical_write">writing</a> and <a href="#typical_read">reading</a> with an ESP8266 are shown below. Complete <a href="#documentation">documentation</a> in aslo shown below.

ThingSpeak offers free data storage and analysis of time-stamped numeric or alphanumeric data. Users can access ThingSpeak by visiting http://thingspeak.com and creating a ThingSpeak user account.

ThingSpeak stores data in channels. Channels support an unlimited number of timestamped observations (think of these as rows in a spreadsheet). Each channel has up to 8 fields (think of these as columns in a speadsheet). Check out this [video](http://www.mathworks.com/videos/introduction-to-thingspeak-107749.html) for an overview.

Channels may be public, where anyone can see the data, or private, where only the owner and select users can read the data. Each channel has an associated Write API Key that is used to control who can write to a channel. In addition, private channels have one or more Read API Keys to control who can read from private channel. An API Key is not required to read from public channels.  Each channel can have up to 8 fields. One field is created by default.

You can visualize and do online analytics of your data on ThingSpeak using the built in version of MATLAB, or use the desktop version of MATLAB to get deeper historical insight. Visit https://www.mathworks.com/hardware-support/thingspeak.html to learn more.

## <a id="typical_write">Typical Write Example</a>
In this case, write to a field with an ESP8266 with an incrementing number.   

```
#include "ThingSpeak.h"
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>

//----------------  Fill in your credentails   ---------------------
char ssid[] = "MySSID";             // your network SSID (name) 
char pass[] = "MyPassword";         // your network password
unsigned long myChannelNumber = 0;  // Replace the 0 with your channel number
const char * myWriteAPIKey = "";    // Paste your ThingSpeak Write API Key between the quotes 
//------------------------------------------------------------------

WiFiClient  client;

int number = 0;

void setup() {
  //Initialize serial and wait for port to open:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  while (!Serial) {
    ; // wait for serial port to connect. Needed for native USB port only
  }

  WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);
  ThingSpeak.begin(client); 
}

void loop() {

  // Connect or reconnect to WiFi
  if(WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED){
    Serial.print("Attempting to connect to SSID: ");
    Serial.println(SECRET_SSID);
    while(WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED){
      WiFi.begin(ssid, pass);
      Serial.print(".");
      delay(5000);     
    } 
    Serial.println("\nConnected.");
  }
  
  // Write to ThingSpeak. There are up to 8 fields in a channel, allowing you to store up to 8 different
  // pieces of information in a channel.  Here, we write to field 1.
  int x = ThingSpeak.writeField(myChannelNumber, 1, number, myWriteAPIKey);
  
  // Check the return code
  if(x == 200){
    Serial.println("Channel update successful.");
  }
  else{
    Serial.println("Problem updating channel. HTTP error code " + String(x));
  }

  number++;
  if(number > 99){
    number = 0;
  }
  
  delay(20000); // Wait 20 seconds before sending a new value
}
```

## <a id="typical_read">Typical Read Example</a>
In this case, read from a public channel and a private channel with an ESP8266.  The public channel is the temperature(F) at MathWorks headquarters.  The private channel is a counter that increments.

 ```
#include "ThingSpeak.h"
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>

//----------------  Fill in your credentails   ---------------------
char ssid[] = "MySSID";     // your network SSID (name) 
char pass[] = "MyPassword"; // your network password
//------------------------------------------------------------------

WiFiClient  client;

unsigned long weatherStationChannelNumber = 12397;
unsigned int temperatureFieldNumber = 4;

unsigned long counterChannelNumber = 298725;
const char * myCounterReadAPIKey = "SODG0O2UZVGKWAWG";
unsigned int counterFieldNumber = 1; 

void setup() {
  //Initialize serial and wait for port to open:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  while (!Serial) {
    ; // wait for serial port to connect. Needed for native USB port only
  }

  WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);  
  ThingSpeak.begin(client);
}

void loop() {

  int statusCode = 0;
  
  // Connect or reconnect to WiFi
  if(WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED){
    Serial.print("Attempting to connect to SSID: ");
    Serial.println(SECRET_SSID);
    while(WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED){
      WiFi.begin(ssid, pass);
      Serial.print(".");
      delay(5000);     
    } 
    Serial.println("\nConnected");
  }

  // Read in field 4 of the public channel recording the temperature
  float temperatureInF = ThingSpeak.readFloatField(weatherStationChannelNumber, temperatureFieldNumber);  

  // Check the status of the read operation to see if it was successful
  statusCode = ThingSpeak.getLastReadStatus();
  if(statusCode == 200){
    Serial.println("Temperature at MathWorks HQ: " + String(temperatureInF) + " deg F");
  }
  else{
    Serial.println("Problem reading channel. HTTP error code " + String(statusCode)); 
  }
  
  delay(15000); // No need to read the temperature too often.

  // Read in field 1 of the private channel which is a counter  
  long count = ThingSpeak.readLongField(counterChannelNumber, counterFieldNumber, myCounterReadAPIKey);  

   // Check the status of the read operation to see if it was successful
  statusCode = ThingSpeak.getLastReadStatus();
  if(statusCode == 200){
    Serial.println("Counter: " + String(count));
  }
  else{
    Serial.println("Problem reading channel. HTTP error code " + String(statusCode)); 
  }
  
  delay(15000); // No need to read the counter too often.
  
}
 ```

## Special Characters
Some characters require '%XX' style URL encoding before sending to ThingSpeak.  The writeField() and writeFields() methods will perform the encoding automatically.  The writeRaw() method will not.

| Character  | Encoding |
|------------|:---------|
|     "      | %22      |
|     %      | %25      |
|     &      | %26      |
|     +      | %2B      |
|     ;      | %3B      |

Control characters, ASCII values 0 though 31, are not accepted by ThingSpeak and will be ignored.  Extended ASCII characters with values above 127 will also be ignored.
